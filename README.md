## Installation

Balsa installer assumes it is running on a vanilla Ubuntu/CentOS/RHEL without any services listening on port 80 or 443 (which should also be open to incoming traffic). Once run, it takes care of every configuration and doesn't require any additional, manual intervention.

To deploy Balsa, download the latest release and run: ```sudo ./install.sh```.  

## Roadmap

What we would like to add on top of Balsa are as follows: 

- A full fledged database
- Calendar integration 
- Gantt chart
- Spell checker
- ENEX dump (for Evernote migration)
- Web clipper (not very soon)
- Better offline work
